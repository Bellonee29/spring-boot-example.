       # Adding Short review
Review on customer class:
The Customer class is well-structured as an entity with all the necessary components for creating a JPA entity. It adheres to best practices for entity design.

Suggestion or Recommendation:
I recommend incorporating Lombok annotations to simplify the boilerplate code and enhance code scalability. This will lead to more concise and maintainable code.

Review on file structuring:
The file structuring appears somewhat disorganized.

Suggestion or Recommendation:
I suggest organizing the code into different packages, such as creating a "model" package for the Customer class and a "repository" package for the CustomerRepository. This will improve code organization and maintainability.

Review on the main class:
The main class contains a substantial amount of code that could be simplified to provide a cleaner entry point for the project.

Suggestion or Recommendation:
I will suggest to create a separate class to act as a controller and handle all the routing, rather than embedding it within the main class. This will help separate concerns and make the code more modular. Always ensure that unnecessary comments are removed before pushing changes to the repository, as they can clutter the codebase and lead to confusion for other developers.

Finally
By following these recommendations, the codebase can become more organized, maintainable, and professional in the software engineering field.
